### 2026-07-03 - Planning

Spec reviewed and restructured into nine session-sized phases. Executor changed from Cline + DeepSeek to Claude Code with Sonnet. Key decisions locked: client-side PDF generation, v1 scope cuts (no URL scraping, no LinkedIn import, PDF/DOCX ingestion only, plain tracking table), atsScore as engine-computed snapshot, DeepSeek runtime exception documented. Next step: open Claude Code session with the Phase 0 kickoff prompt.

**Date:** 2026-07-03
**Phase:** 0 - Repo and toolchain
**Branch:** phase-0-setup

**Completed:**
- Next.js App Router scaffolded with TypeScript strict, Tailwind v4, ESLint, pnpm
- shadcn/ui initialized (components.json, button.tsx, utils.ts)
- drizzle-orm and @neondatabase/serverless added as dependencies; drizzle-kit as dev dependency; drizzle.config.ts pointing at an empty schema.ts placeholder
- Folder skeleton created per PLAN.md file structure (route groups, api routes, component folders, lib folders, types), empty dirs held with .gitkeep
- Placeholder home page and metadata updated (no em dashes, no default create-next-app copy)
- .env.local created locally with blank placeholders for DATABASE_URL, AUTH_SECRET, GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET, DEEPSEEK_API_KEY (gitignored, not committed)
- README.md rewritten with project description and setup steps
- `pnpm dev` verified serving the placeholder page (HTTP 200), `pnpm build` verified clean with zero TypeScript errors
- Git repo initialized, committed on phase-0-setup, pushed to https://github.com/vikrantgadgil/resume-builder

**Blockers:** None.

**Next step:** Open a new session for Phase 1 (schema and auth). Before that session, the user needs to: create a Neon Postgres project and put its connection string in .env.local as DATABASE_URL; register a Google OAuth client (OAuth consent screen + credentials) and put GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID / GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET in .env.local; generate an AUTH_SECRET value. Phase 0 branch has not yet been merged to main; merge phase-0-setup before starting Phase 1 per the one-branch-per-phase rule.
